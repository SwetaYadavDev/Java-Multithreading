Multithreading in Java is a powerful feature that allows multiple threads (lightweight sub-processes) to run concurrently, enabling efficient utilization of CPU resources. It is commonly used in real-time, interactive, and high-performance applications such as web servers, games, and data processing systems. Javaâ€™s built-in Thread class and Runnable interface make it easy to create and manage threads, while synchronization ensures safe access to shared resources.
